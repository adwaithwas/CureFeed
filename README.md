# CureFeed

A minimal, intentional YouTube feed.

CureFeed helps you keep up with selected YouTube channels without falling into algorithm-driven doom scrolling.  
It treats YouTube like an **inbox**, not an endless feed.


## Features
- Shows the latest videos from channels you explicitly choose
- One video per channel (no infinite scroll)
- No recommendations or algorithmic feed
- Remembers what you’ve already watched
- Clean, distraction-free video player
- Channel-specific pages with recent uploads only


## What it does NOT do
- No trending or explore pages
- No autoplay chains
- No history page
- No community posts
- No notifications

These are intentional design choices.


## Setup

Clone the repository, configure your channels, install dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/curefeed.git
cd curefeed
cp channels.example.json channels.json
edit channels.json according to your choice
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
