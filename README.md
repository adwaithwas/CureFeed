# CureFeed

A minimal, intentional YouTube feed.

CureFeed helps you keep up with selected YouTube channels without falling into algorithm-driven doom scrolling.  
It treats YouTube like an **inbox**, not an endless feed.


## Features
- Shows the latest videos from channels you explicitly choose
- One video per channel (no infinite scroll)
- No recommendations or algorithmic feed
- Remembers what you’ve already watched
- Clean, distraction-free video player
- Channel-specific pages with recent uploads only


## What it does NOT do
- No trending or explore pages
- No autoplay chains
- No history page
- No community posts
- No notifications

These are intentional design choices.


## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Change channels.example.json -> channels.json
3. Add your channel IDs
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python app.py`

CureFeed is an inbox, not a feed.
